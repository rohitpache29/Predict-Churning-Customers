## Introduction

Customer churn is a common problem in various industries. This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. The primary goal is to assist businesses in making informed decisions to reduce customer churn and increase customer retention.

## Features

- **Churn Prediction:** The core feature of this project is the churn prediction model that helps businesses identify customers at risk of churning.
- **Model Deployment:** We provide resources and guidelines for deploying the trained churn prediction model in a real-world application.
- **Interactive Notebooks:** The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter notebooks illustrating data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation about project components, usage, and best practices can be found in the `docs` directory.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Predict-Churning-Customers.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Predict-Churning-Customers`
3. Set up a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

1. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to understand the end-to-end project workflow.
2. Use the provided notebooks to preprocess data, train the churn prediction model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Refer to the `deployment` directory for guidance on deploying the trained model in a production environment.
4. Customize the code, model parameters, and data preprocessing steps according to your specific use case.

## Dataset

You can find the dataset Credit Card customers file. 

## Model

We employ a [briefly describe the machine learning model or approach] to predict customer churn. The model is trained using the preprocessed dataset to learn patterns associated with churned customers.

## Evaluation

The performance of the churn prediction model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model can predict customer churn. Visualizations of the model's performance are presented in the notebooks.
